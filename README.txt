Final Website

Closing the Gap is a browser extension which helps users navigate the internet, making slight changes for the user, that allow them to work more efficiently online. Through research I have been able to understand better what users with Dyslexia may need and how creating my interface I couldn't make a 'one size fits all' browser extension. Overall I am pleased with my final outcome, I am interested in taking this to the next level for project two and would personally want to use Closing the Gap in my everyday life.
